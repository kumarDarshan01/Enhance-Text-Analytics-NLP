# Enhance-Text-Analytics-NLP
A project to improve text analytics data quality using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Jupyter and Streamlit.
üìä Enhanced Text Analytics Data Quality with NLP

This project develops a modular NLP pipeline and an interactive Streamlit app to improve text data quality ‚Äî tackling noise, inconsistencies, bias, and lack of context in unstructured text from sources like reviews and social media.

üîç Overview

In today‚Äôs data-centric world, the quality of text data heavily influences analytical outcomes. This project uses NLP to clean, normalize, enrich, and analyze text to improve downstream analytics such as sentiment detection and entity recognition.
